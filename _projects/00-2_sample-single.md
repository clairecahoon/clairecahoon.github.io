## Excerpt from *The Picture of Dorian Grey*

![A dark wooden bookcase full of books]({{ "/assets/images/default-4.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .align-right} When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner. They must be hidden away somewhere. He
unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, and
put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards.
Then he pulled out his watch.[^1] It was twenty minutes to
two.

He sat down, and began to think. Every year—every
month, almost— men were strangled in England for what
he had done. There had been a madness of murder in the
air. Some red star had come too close to the earth.

Evidence? What evidence was there against him? Basil
Hallward had left the house at eleven. No one had seen
him come in again. Most of the servants were at Selby
Royal. His valet had gone to bed.

Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the
midnight train, as he had intended. With his curious
reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions
would be aroused. Months? Everything could be
destroyed long before then.[^2]

A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat
and hat, and went out into the hall. There he paused,
hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman outside on
the pavement, and seeing the flash of the lantern reflected
in the window. He waited, holding his breath. 

After a few moments he opened the front door, and
slipped out, shutting it very gently behind him. Then he
began ringing the bell. In about ten minutes his valet
appeared, half dressed, and looking very drowsy.

‘I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,’ he
said, stepping in; ‘but I had forgotten my latch-key. What
time is it?’[^3]

‘Five minutes past two, sir,’ answered the man, looking
at the clock and yawning.
