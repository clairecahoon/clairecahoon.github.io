# This file sets the titles of the category gallery sections that
# display on the home page.

# This file must be edited if changes are made to display_categories in
# the front matter of index.md.

# You may add or remove categories from this list.

# The items under display_categories here should match those in index.md,
# so make sure you edit both files.

# The text in quotes is the text that will actually display as headings
# for each category on the rendered home page.

display_categories:
  getting-started: 'Getting Started'
  how-to: 'How-To'
